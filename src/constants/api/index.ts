          'This is a museum at Abdeen Palace that has a wonderful collection of gifts that were given by different rulers in the world to the Egyptian royal family as well as some of their belongings like an amazing silverware collection and dinnerware which I fell in love with. It was an extraordinary experience to walk through the gate of this beautiful palace into the amazing spacious gardens and look at the palace, which is not open to the public right now, looking forward to visit it one day, you can only visit the museum that you should not miss, loved the golden sword that was gifted by King AbdulAziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia to king Fuad the first. I hope that all the Egyptian palaces gets renovated and opened to the public.',
